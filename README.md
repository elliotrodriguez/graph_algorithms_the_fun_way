This is the code for the Graph Algorithms the Fun Way book by Jeremy Kubica for No Starch Press.

This work was done on:

- M3 Macbook Pro
- Python 3.11.7 virtual env
- tests using pytest

**Contributing Guidelines**

There are a few disclaimers in the book concerning some programming choices, as well as listed opportunities where code can be improved. 

Those looking to learm more about these algorithms, or have contributions to improving the code, are welcome and encouraged. 

Please clearly mark in docsource that the chances are different from the original source. Otherwise, all code source is entered by hand as presented in the book. 

***Notes On AI***

Some AI is used to generate tests, docstrings, and other documentation. Code is as written from the original source unless it is commented to reflect changes.

**Install**

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Why?** 

Because I wanted to learn about graph algorithms and I wanted to improve my Python skills.
